// In Node.js, requests refer to the process of making HTTP requests to other servers or APIs. HTTP requests allow you to send data to a server and receive a response back, which can then be used in your application.
requests('https://google.com/foo/bar', { streaming })
.on('data', function (chunk) {
  console.log(chunk)
})
.on('end', function (err) {
  if (err) return console.log('connection closed due to errors', err);
 
  console.log('end');
});

// First, we have the requests function, which is used to make an HTTP request to a server. In this case, it's sending a GET request to the URL "https://google.com/foo/bar".

// The second argument to requests is an object with an option called "streaming". This option tells the library to stream the response back to the client in chunks rather than waiting for the entire response to be received before sending it back.

// The requests function returns an object that emits events. The first event listener listens for the "data" event, which is emitted by the requests library when a new chunk of data is received from the server. The code inside the event listener simply logs each chunk of data to the console.

// The second event listener listens for the "end" event, which is emitted by the requests library when the entire response has been received. If an error occurred during the request, the "end" event will be emitted with an error object. If there was no error, the code logs "end" to the console.

// So, in simpler terms, this code sends an HTTP GET request to "https://google.com/foo/bar" and logs the response data to the console as it's received. When the entire response has been received, it logs "end" to the console. The "streaming" option is used to handle large responses that can't be loaded all at once, and instead receive them in smaller chunks.
